# PrivateObject Missing From MsTest .Core 
Just a demo for PrivateObject  and how its missing from MSTest .net Core unittest project.

I made it work for .net Framework using https://www.infragistics.com/community/blogs/b/dhananjay_kumar/posts/how-to-unit-test-private-methods-in-ms-test as a reference.

But **I could not get the .net Core one to work**.

I tweeted to @debug_mode and @VisualStudio  https://twitter.com/SturlaThorvalds/status/1002960170975195139

and got an answer https://twitter.com/debug_mode/status/1003072754944372736

But I stil **canÂ´t find out if PrivateObject has been removed or just moved around (or even depricated) in .net Core...** just no info..
I even tried lots of other MSTest extension packages without luck.

Hope this helps somebody.. I will update when I have answers.
