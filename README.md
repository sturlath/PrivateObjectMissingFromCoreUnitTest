# PrivateObjectMissingFromCoreUnitTest
Just a demo for PrivateObject  and how its missing from MSTest .net Core unittest project.

I made it work for .net Framework using https://www.infragistics.com/community/blogs/b/dhananjay_kumar/posts/how-to-unit-test-private-methods-in-ms-test as a reference.

But could not get the .net Core one to work.

I tweeted to @debug_mode and @VisualStudio  https://twitter.com/SturlaThorvalds/status/1002960170975195139

and got an answer https://twitter.com/debug_mode/status/1003072754944372736

But I stil can´t find out if PrivateObject has been removed or just removed (or even depricated) in .net Core... just no info..

Hope this helps somebody.. I will update when I have answers.
